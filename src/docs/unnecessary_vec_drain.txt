### What it does
Checks for usage of `vec.drain(..)` with RangeFull that is not bound to a value `let`.

### Why is this bad?
This creates an iterator that is dropped immediately.

`vec.clear()` also shows clearer intention.

### Example
```
let mut vec: Vec<i32> = Vec::new();
 vec.drain(..);
```
Use instead:
```
let mut vec: Vec<i32> = Vec::new();
vec.clear();
```
